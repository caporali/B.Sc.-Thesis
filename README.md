# Description

Reviewing some relevant theoretical results, we analyzed neural networks (NNs) as a formal model. We presented some versions of the density result of the functions that can be generated by NNs in $L^p$ spaces and in $C(X)$ with $X$ compact in $\mathbb{R}^k$. Then, we studied the Gaussian asymptotic behavior of random NNs. The work includes experiments developed independently using Python's PyTorch module. <br>

The source code for the simulations can be found in the [code](https://github.com/caporali/bsc_thesis/tree/main/code) folder. it is completely written in Python (version 3.9.13) making use of the Pytorch module. <br>
It consists of 3 main experiments found in the [main](https://github.com/caporali/bsc_thesis/tree/main/code/main) folder. The main codes to be executed are as follows:
- [torch_test.py](https://github.com/caporali/bsc_thesis/tree/main/code/main/torch_test.py); 
- [exp_1.py](https://github.com/caporali/bsc_thesis/tree/main/code/main/exp_1.py); 
- [exp_2.py](https://github.com/caporali/bsc_thesis/tree/main/code/main/exp_2.py). 

All files are accompanied by comments and clarifications (written mostly in Italian). <br>
