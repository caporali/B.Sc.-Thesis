# B.Sc. Thesis
<p> Thesis in applied mathematics focused on the study of deep neural networks (experiments in PyTorch). The work is written completely in Italian. <p>
Title of the thesis:
<ul>
  <li> <em>Reti neurali profonde: capacit√† di approssimazione e convergenza a processi gaussiani</em> (original) </li>
  <li> <em>Deep neural networks: approximation capabilities and gaussian behaviour</em> (english version) </li>
</ul>

# Description
The source code for the simulations can be found in the [code](https://github.com/caporali/B.Sc.-Thesis/tree/main/code) folder. it is completely written in Python (version 3.9.0) making use of the Pytorch module. <br>
It consists of 3 main experiments found in the [main](https://github.com/caporali/B.Sc.-Thesis/tree/main/code/main) folder. The main codes to be executed are as follows:
<ul>
  <li> [torch_test.py](https://github.com/caporali/B.Sc.-Thesis/tree/main/code/main/torch_test.py); </li>
  <li> [exp_1.py](https://github.com/caporali/B.Sc.-Thesis/tree/main/code/main/exp_1.py); </li>
  <li> [exp_2.py](https://github.com/caporali/B.Sc.-Thesis/tree/main/code/main/exp_2.py). </li>
</ul>
All files are accompanied by comments and clarifications (written mostly in Italian). <br>
